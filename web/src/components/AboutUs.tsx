          <p>
            Women must possess the self worth, confidence and freedom to choose
            what they may with regard to their private and professional choices
            alike.A proper nurturing, polishing and sharpening of those skills
            is only made possible through better education, awareness and a
            space to freely express oneself. Empowerment of women is a necessity
            for the very development of a society.it helps women to promote an
            overall development of society, grant women economic independence,
            reduce scope domestic violence and sexual exploitation,eradicate
            corruption, get rid of poverty and in-turn facilitate national
            development.

            <blockquote className="my-4 font-bold text-xl">
              "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change

            </blockquote>{" "}
            The conventional assembly of education inputs is not improving
            learning outcomes. This presents a fundamental challenge to the way
            that governments, development partners and communities are managing
            and supporting education systems. A new, more radical approach that
            focusses on enhancing learning outcomes is long overdue and forms
            the basis for this strategy. Jagathi Foundation outlines the shift
            towards a greater focus on improving learning outcomes, including
            supporting the breadth of skills that allow young people to become
            agile, adaptive learners and citizens, equipped to navigate
            personal, social, academic, economic and environmental challenges.

          <p>
            Number of people suffering from the major and severe health problems
            in rural sections and urban slums. The biggest reason of these
            health disparities here is malnutrition and pathetic slum living
            facilities. The air they breathe, the water they drink and even food
            they eat are totally contrary and pathetic to the normal and healthy
            living facilities. Jagathi Foundation support basic health and
            social needs of underprivileged sections of the society like poor,
            women, elderly, children etc with awareness on hygiene, nutrition
            needs and lifestyle changes.

          <h1 className="my-4 text-black text-2xl">Environment</h1>
          <p>
            Jagathi Foundation sensitize the people about value and importance
            of the environment Create awareness on how to reduce the usage of
            plastic and pesticides which are harmful for health. Proper
            conservation and utilization of Natural resources like water & soil
            and protect the lakes, ponds from polluting. Also rejuvenate wells &
            Ponds, bring them back to life for alternate source of water and
            educate to do proper disposal of solid waste.
